# rpm-calculator

A terminal-based RMP calculator written in C with an infinite stack implemented by a linked list. You can compile the code by typing: gcc -std=c99 -o rpm main.c

## Usage

This calculator accepts only single digit numbers. So, (24 5 +=) will not work; however, (2 5 +=) will work and will evaluate to (5 + 2).
